# Construction Client App

This directory contains the Flutter code for the client application.

## Initialization

Since this project was generated without the full Flutter CLI tools, you need to initialize the platform-specific files (Android, iOS, Web, etc.).

Run the following command in this directory:

```bash
flutter create .
```

This will generate the `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, etc. directories while keeping the existing `lib/` and `pubspec.yaml`.

## Running the App

To run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Dependencies

- `provider`: State management
- `http` / `dio`: API calls
- `google_fonts`: Typography
